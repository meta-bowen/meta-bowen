## 👨‍💻Brief introduction

- 🔭Linkkey Co-funder / GGSlayer PM
- 🔗Blockchain Developer
- 🖥️Web3.0 Entrepreneur



## 🗺️Web3 experience

In 2021 I co-founded the web3 social platform (🔑[Linkkey](https://linkkey.io)) with friends, in 2022 my friends and I built the social application-chain (♾️[Ulas](https://ulas.network)) in the Cosmos ecosystem, and in 2023 I joined an established CEX as head of production and R&D to help build their Gamefi aggregation platform (🎮[GGSlayer](https://ggslayer.io)).

Certainly, earlier (2020) I was working on the development and management of the storage blockchain (🎛️[mwfs](https://mw.run)).
